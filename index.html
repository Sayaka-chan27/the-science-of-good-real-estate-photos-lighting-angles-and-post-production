            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Creating stunning real estate photos is both an art and a science.

            <h2>The Role of Lighting in Real Estate Photography</h2>
            <h3>Natural Light</h3>
            <p>Natural light is one of the most important factors in real estate photography. Shooting during the golden hour or ensuring rooms are well-lit with natural light can make photos look warm and inviting.</p>
            <h3>Artificial Lighting</h3>
            <p>In darker spaces, artificial lighting can be used to brighten the scene and create a balanced look. Proper lighting ensures that every detail is visible and enhances the overall appeal of the property.</p>

            <h2>Choosing the Right Angles</h2>
            <h3>Wide-Angle Shots</h3>
            <p>Wide-angle shots are essential for capturing the full scope of a room. They make spaces appear larger and more open, giving potential buyers a better sense of the layout.</p>
            <h3>Highlighting Key Features</h3>
            <p>Strategic angles can emphasize a property’s unique features, such as a fireplace, modern kitchen, or scenic views. This helps draw attention to the elements that make the property stand out.</p>

            <h2>The Importance of Post-Production</h2>
            <h3>Enhancing Visual Appeal</h3>
            <p>Post-production is where good photos become great. Professional editing can correct lighting, adjust colors, and remove distractions, ensuring that every image looks polished and professional.</p>
            <h3>Consistency Across Listings</h3>
            <p>Consistent editing across all photos creates a cohesive look that enhances your brand and builds trust with potential buyers.</p>
